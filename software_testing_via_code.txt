--------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Unit Testing:(it is about three steps -> arrange,assert,act)
 AAA: Arrange Act Assert
Arrange:
       arrange the data, objects,variables
Act on:
       Perform the operations
Assert:
      It will verify of the results of opperations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

test fixture:
   baseline components
          components , variables, data etc. are available to all test cases
   test cases:
          a set of conditions to determine whether module/component is working properly
   test suit:
          group of test cases
          customer test suite
   test runner:
          tool used to run the test cases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

current folder test:
  pytest:
   # run single test suite.
   coverage run -m pytest .\file name
   
   #run all test cases in current folder
   coverage run -m pytest
   
   #generate coverage for single source
    coverage html --include=..\mod1\1.py(file name)
   
    #generate coverage for all source files tested
     coverage html
